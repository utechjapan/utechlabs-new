A well-designed network is essential for a secure and efficient homelab. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) allow you to segment your network into separate logical groups, improving security, performance, and manageability. In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of VLANs and walk you through setting them up in your homelab.

## What You’ll Need

- A managed switch that supports VLANs (e.g., TP-Link, Netgear, or Ubiquiti).  
- A router or firewall capable of VLAN tagging (e.g., pfSense, OPNSense).  
- Basic understanding of IP addresses and subnetting.

## Step 1: Understand VLAN Basics

### **What Are VLANs?**
VLANs divide a physical network into multiple virtual networks. Devices on different VLANs cannot communicate directly without a router or Layer 3 switch.

### **Why Use VLANs?**
- **Security**: Isolate devices to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Performance**: Reduce broadcast traffic by grouping devices logically.  
- **Management**: Simplify network organization for IoT, servers, and workstations.

## Step 2: Plan Your VLANs

Create a plan for how you’ll segment your network. Example:  
- **VLAN 10**: Trusted devices (PCs, laptops).  
- **VLAN 20**: IoT devices (smart bulbs, cameras).  
- **VLAN 30**: Servers (homelab VMs, NAS).  

Assign each VLAN an IP subnet:  
- VLAN 10: `192.168.10.0/24`  
- VLAN 20: `192.168.20.0/24`  
- VLAN 30: `192.168.30.0/24`

## Step 3: Configure VLANs on Your Switch

1. **Access the Switch Management Interface**:  
   - Open your browser and go to the switch's IP address.  
   - Log in with admin credentials.  

2. **Create VLANs**:  
   - Navigate to the VLAN configuration page.  
   - Add VLANs and assign each a unique VLAN ID (e.g., 10, 20, 30).  

3. **Tag Ports for Trunk and Access**:  
   - **Trunk Ports**: Carry multiple VLANs to your router or other switches.  
   - **Access Ports**: Assign specific VLANs to end devices.  

Example:  
- Port 1: Trunk (carries VLAN 10, 20, and 30).  
- Port 2: Access (VLAN 10).  
- Port 3: Access (VLAN 20).

## Step 4: Configure VLANs on Your Router or Firewall

1. **Enable VLAN Tagging**:  
   - Access your router or firewall’s management interface.  
   - Go to the interface or network settings and enable VLAN tagging.  

2. **Create VLAN Interfaces**:  
   - Add a virtual interface for each VLAN (e.g., `VLAN 10`, `VLAN 20`, `VLAN 30`).  
   - Assign each VLAN a static IP from its respective subnet.  

3. **Set Up DHCP**:  
   - Configure a DHCP server for each VLAN to assign IP addresses automatically.  

4. **Add Firewall Rules**:  
   - Allow or block traffic between VLANs based on your security needs.  
   - Example: Block traffic from IoT VLAN to trusted devices VLAN.

## Step 5: Verify and Test VLANs

1. Connect a device to a VLAN-configured port on your switch.  
2. Check the device’s IP address to ensure it’s in the correct subnet.  
3. Test communication between VLANs:  
   - Ping devices on different VLANs to verify connectivity (or lack thereof if blocked by firewall rules).

## FAQs

**Q: Can I use VLANs with an unmanaged switch?**  
A: No, VLANs require a managed switch capable of VLAN tagging (802.1Q standard).

**Q: How many VLANs can I create?**  
A: The limit depends on your hardware. Most managed switches support up to 4096 VLAN IDs.

**Q: Do VLANs slow down network performance?**  
A: No, VLANs typically improve performance by reducing broadcast traffic.

**Q: How do I secure inter-VLAN traffic?**  
A: Use firewall rules to control traffic between VLANs, allowing only necessary communication.

**Q: Can I use VLANs on Wi-Fi?**  
A: Yes, many access points support SSID-to-VLAN mapping, allowing you to segment wireless traffic.

**Q: What happens if a device is connected to the wrong VLAN?**  
A: The device will receive an IP address from the wrong subnet and may not access intended resources.

**Q: How do I troubleshoot VLAN issues?**  
A: Check the following:  
   - Correct VLAN IDs on switch ports.  
   - Proper IP subnet configuration on VLAN interfaces.  
   - Firewall rules blocking unintended traffic.
