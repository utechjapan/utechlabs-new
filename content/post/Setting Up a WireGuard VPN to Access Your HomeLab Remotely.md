## What You’ll Need

- A server or virtual machine to host the WireGuard VPN.  
- Basic knowledge of networking and port forwarding.  
- A static public IP or dynamic DNS for remote access.  

---

## Step 1: Install WireGuard

1. **Update and install WireGuard**:  
    ````bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y wireguard
    ````

2. **Verify the installation**:  
    ````bash
    wg --version
    ````

---

## Step 2: Generate Keys

1. **Generate the server’s private and public keys**:  
    ````bash
    wg genkey | tee server_private.key | wg pubkey > server_public.key
    ````

2. **Save the keys securely**:  
   The private key will be in `server_private.key`, and the public key will be in `server_public.key`.

---

## Step 3: Configure the WireGuard Server

1. **Create a configuration file**:  
    ````bash
    sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
    ````

2. **Add the following configuration**:  
    ```ini
    [Interface]
    Address = 10.0.0.1/24
    PrivateKey = <server_private_key>
    ListenPort = 51820

    [Peer]
    PublicKey = <client_public_key>
    AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
    ````

   Replace `<server_private_key>` and `<client_public_key>` with the respective values.

3. **Set the appropriate file permissions**:  
    ````bash
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
    ````

4. **Start the WireGuard interface**:  
    ````bash
    sudo wg-quick up wg0
    ````

5. **Enable WireGuard to start on boot**:  
    ````bash
    sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
    ````

## Step 4: Set Up Port Forwarding on Your Router

1. Access your router’s admin interface (usually at `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`).  
2. Navigate to the port forwarding section.  
3. Forward port `51820` (UDP) to your WireGuard server’s internal IP address.

## Step 5: Configure the Client

1. **Install WireGuard on the client device**:  
    - For Linux:  
        ````bash
        sudo apt install -y wireguard
        ````
    - For Windows, macOS, or mobile devices, download WireGuard from the [official site](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).  

2. **Generate the client’s private and public keys**:  
    ````bash
    wg genkey | tee client_private.key | wg pubkey > client_public.key
    ````

3. **Create the client configuration file**:  
    ````bash
    nano client.conf
    ````

4. **Add the following configuration**:  
    ```ini
    [Interface]
    Address = 10.0.0.2/24
    PrivateKey = <client_private_key>

    [Peer]
    PublicKey = <server_public_key>
    Endpoint = <your_public_ip>:51820
    AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
    PersistentKeepalive = 21
    ````

   Replace `<client_private_key>`, `<server_public_key>`, and `<your_public_ip>` with the respective values.

5. **Import the configuration on the client**:  
    - For Linux:  
        ````bash
        sudo wg-quick up ./client.conf
        ````
    - For mobile apps, scan the QR code generated from the configuration.

---

## Step 6: Test the Connection

1. **Ping the server from the client**:  
    ````bash
    ping 10.0.0.1
    ````

2. If successful, try accessing resources in your homelab via the VPN.

## FAQs

**Q: What is WireGuard’s default encryption?**  
A: WireGuard uses modern cryptographic primitives like ChaCha20, Poly1305, and Curve25519 for secure, lightweight encryption.

**Q: Can I use WireGuard with dynamic IP addresses?**  
A: Yes, use a dynamic DNS service (e.g., DuckDNS) to resolve your public IP.

**Q: How many clients can connect to the server?**  
A: WireGuard supports multiple clients. Add a new `[Peer]` section for each client in the server configuration.

**Q: Is WireGuard faster than OpenVPN?**  
A: Yes, WireGuard is generally faster due to its minimal codebase and efficient encryption.

**Q: How do I stop the VPN?**  
A: Use the following command:  
    ````bash
    sudo wg-quick down wg0
    ````

**Q: Can I use WireGuard on a Raspberry Pi?**  
A: Yes, WireGuard works efficiently on Raspberry Pi, making it a great choice for homelab setups.

**Q: How do I troubleshoot connection issues?**  
A: Check:  
   - Firewall rules on the server.  
   - Port forwarding on the router.  
   - Correct keys in configuration files.
