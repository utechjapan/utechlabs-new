Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) is a powerful, open-source platform for virtualization. It allows you to run virtual machines (VMs) and containers efficiently, making it perfect for homelabs. This guide walks you through deploying a Proxmox VE server, enabling you to consolidate workloads and experiment with virtualized environments.

---

## What You’ll Need

- A dedicated machine for Proxmox VE (minimum specs: 4 GB RAM, 64-bit processor, and 32 GB storage).  
- Proxmox VE ISO file from the [Proxmox download page](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads).  
- A USB drive (at least 8 GB) for creating bootable media.  
- A reliable internet connection.

---

## Step 1: Prepare the Installation Media

1. Download the Proxmox VE ISO file from the official website.

2. Use a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable USB drive with the Proxmox ISO.

---

## Step 2: Install Proxmox VE

1. Insert the bootable USB into your server and boot from it.  
2. Follow the installation wizard:  
   - Accept the license agreement.  
   - Select the target disk for installation.  
   - Configure the root password and email address.  
   - Set the network configuration (assign a static IP address for easier access).  

3. Complete the installation and reboot the server. Remove the USB drive during the reboot.

---

## Step 3: Access the Proxmox Web Interface

1. On another device, open a web browser and go to:  
```
https://<your_proxmox_ip>:8006
```

2. Log in using the root credentials set during installation.

---

## Step 4: Update and Configure Proxmox VE

1. Update Proxmox VE to ensure it has the latest features and security patches:  
```
apt update && apt full-upgrade -y
```

2. Disable the enterprise repository (if you’re not using a subscription):  
```
sed -i 's|deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian|#deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian|' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
```

3. Add the Proxmox community repository:  
```
echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-no-subscription" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-subscription.list
```

4. Refresh package lists and update:  
```
apt update && apt full-upgrade -y
```

## Step 5: Set Up Storage

1. Navigate to the **Datacenter** section in the web interface.  
2. Configure storage for VMs and containers:  
- Add local storage for ISO images and backups.  
- Add networked storage (NFS, CIFS) if needed.

---

## Step 6: Create Your First Virtual Machine (VM)

1. Upload an ISO image (e.g., Ubuntu) to your Proxmox storage:  
- Go to **Datacenter** > **Storage** > **ISO Images** > **Upload**.

2. Create a new VM:  
- Navigate to **Create VM** in the Proxmox web interface.  
- Follow the wizard to assign resources like CPU, RAM, and disk space.  

3. Start the VM and install the operating system.

---

## Step 7: Configure Containers (Optional)

Proxmox VE supports LXC containers, which are lightweight alternatives to VMs.  

1. Download container templates:  
- Go to **Datacenter** > **Storage** > **CT Templates** > **Templates** > **Download**.  

2. Create a container:  
- Navigate to **Create CT** and follow the wizard.

---

## Step 8: Backup and Restore

1. Set up backups to ensure data safety:  
- Go to **Datacenter** > **Backup** > **Add** to schedule backups.  

2. Restore VMs or containers by selecting **Restore** from the backup menu.

## FAQs

**Q: What is the difference between a VM and a container in Proxmox VE?**  
A: VMs emulate an entire operating system, while containers share the host kernel, making them more lightweight and faster to deploy.

**Q: Can I use Proxmox VE on a Raspberry Pi?**  
A: No, Proxmox VE requires a 64-bit x86 processor, which Raspberry Pis do not support.

**Q: How do I add a second storage drive to Proxmox VE?**  
A: Use the web interface to configure storage:  
- Go to **Datacenter** > **Storage** > **Add** and choose the storage type (e.g., Directory, LVM, NFS).

**Q: Does Proxmox VE support GPU passthrough?**  
A: Yes, Proxmox VE supports GPU passthrough for VMs, allowing direct access to the GPU for intensive workloads.

**Q: Is Proxmox VE free?**  
A: Yes, Proxmox VE is free and open source. However, you can purchase a subscription for access to the enterprise repository and support.

**Q: How do I access VMs from another device?**  
A: Use the Proxmox web interface to access VMs via the integrated console or configure network access to the VM for SSH, RDP, or VNC.

**Q: Can I run Proxmox VE as a VM itself?**  
A: Yes, Proxmox VE can run as a VM for testing purposes, but nested virtualization must be supported by the host.
